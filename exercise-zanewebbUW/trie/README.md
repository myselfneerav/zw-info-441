# trie

Through this exercise, you'll get comfortable with building data structures with Go.
We will specifically look at how to build a `set` using an important key feature of 
hash maps. You'll then utilize this `set` for your `trie` as part of the requirements for
`Assignment 5: Searching Users`

## Instructions 
Your objective is to implement all of the methods listed out for `int64set.go`. 
The instructions are listed in the comments. You are provided with test code that you can run 
in order to test each method that you implement. 

Once finished with `int64set.go`, you can then start implementing your `trie` 
(this is so that you can start your assignment early).
