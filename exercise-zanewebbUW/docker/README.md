# docker 
As our course concept moves to containerization, we'll practice utilizing common `Docker` commands in order to 
automate the deployment of applications. 

Be mindful that the grading of these exercises are based on effort. That being said, the required amount of 
effort should at most take you ~1 hour to do and we expect that you **actually** attempt them. However if you are not able
to finish the exercise in class, we highly encourage to finish the exercise after class since it will help a lot for your assignments.
