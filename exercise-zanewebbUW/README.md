This repo was created for you by GitHub Classroom. You do not need to fork this repo into your own account. 
It is already private to you.

### Pulling Updates
Periodically we will add new starter files to the master repo this repo was created from. To get those new files into 
your repo, add the following remote to your cloned (you only need to do this once on any given clone):

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/info441/exercises.git
```

Then pull updates from that remote using this command:

```bash
git pull upstream master
```
